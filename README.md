# projet-RottenTomatoes
a IMDB_like website made in 1 week in a team of 4, using react with the next.js framework and the IMDB api.
We had to connect to the api, create endpoints and responses matching our needs. The user must authenticate, 
then can add movies to his favorite list. We display the movies in the database, the favorites in a caroussel, 
and a film page that i specifically took care of (with title, duration, credits, poster, trailer, etc..).
